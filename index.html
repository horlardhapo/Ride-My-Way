					 How it Works Tip information. Is an Application that create an avenue people of the same neighbourhood to offer rides.
					Available rides that match your route will be displayed and you can join any of the rides. [If none matches your route, you can choose to get notified when thereâ€™s a ride for your route]
					To ensure the platform is safe, you need to sign in using your Facebook and LinkedIn accounts as well as verify your phone number.
					The cost of the ride will be calculated. The first 30 rides joined on the platform are free (Paid for by Jekalo) . This means if you join a ride asap, your ride might be free.
					[The amount you pay on JEKALO is about the same price as using a commercial bus and cheaper than a taxi.]
					You will get notified once the ride owner has confirmed your ride request.
